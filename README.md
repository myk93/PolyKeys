# PolyKeys

## Description
This Python script automatically detects the input language (Hebrew, English, Arabic, or Russian) and converts the text to the corresponding keyboard layout of another language.
It supports bidirectional conversion, allowing users to switch between languages seamlessly based on their keyboard layout.
The script works on both Windows and Linux systems, 
and includes mappings for Hebrew, English, Russian, and partial support for Arabic keyboard layouts.
Perfect for correcting mistyped text when the wrong keyboard layout is accidentally used
